        "Hotel business is a lucrative yet very volatile business segment. It’s dependent on multiple criteria like type of hotel, business seasons, customer segments, multiple modes of booking, amenities, services and many more. Over the past couple of decades, it saw a massive surge in terms of profit, but then global pandemic hit worldwide and almost all industry sectors observed a deprivation in their business with ‘Hotel’ sector taking a major blow. This has made many entrepreneurs and business leaders realize how important it is to be strategic and leverage data analysis for making intelligent business decisions, thereby penetrating the market deep and gain more marketshares.\n",

Secondary objective is to help the customers in deciding the best period to visit places while availing low accommodation cost benefits. In this project we were provided dataset containing booking information about two types of hotel and various other related booking criteria.\n",

        "First step of approach involved Data Exploration and Inspection over the raw data. Second step involved Data Cleaning by handling null values, dropping irrelevant columns and rows, parsing date in string to Datetime format and adding new feature columns that can help in better decision support. Final step involved performing a comprehensive data analysis over clean data to analyze the factors that affect hotel bookings and creating Data Visualization for the same. These factors can further helps in drawing booking, pricing and other correlated trends which can further aid in predicting business at high level.\n",
